# XSGE (eXtremely Simple Game Engine) #

XSGE is, as its name says, a extremely simple game engine. It is made of only a few lines of code, but it aims to be as easy and flexible as possible.

## Helping out:

If you got a fix to something, or even if you implemented a nice feature, you can proceed that way to get your code on my project:

* Fork this project.
* Create your fix.
* Push to your fork.
* Send me a pull request.

Just remember: **we won't add any code if it isn't simple and legible, or if it breaks the simplicity of the project.**
If you have a feature that adds a big layer of complexity to XSGE, such as scripting, you can create your own project based on it. Just send me a message, so i can see your code.

XSGE uses a default of 4 spaces for identing, and opening brackets on the line after the statement. We also compile it with -Wall and -Werror, so make sure no warnings raises during compilation. Testing on OS X/Linux/Windows is also appreciated.

If you aren't a programmer, you're out of luck, but you can always learn how to programming (XSGE's simplicity makes it a good project to study) and trying to create a project based on it. Then, you can file any bugs or issues you find.
